# Preparation for the SciGraph Hack Day

## Setting up 

1. Bring your Laptop & Charger
1. Install Slack - that'll be our main communication tool for the day!

## Reads the Docs 

It'd be great if you took some time to familiarize witht the SciGraph data. Please use the following links to get started with it.

## Think of some Hacking Ideas 

* What topics are newly emerging in sustainable cities research? What is attracting the most attention?
* Who is putting money into work on cities?
* Who are the top people working on sustainable cities?
* Data Visualization: Develop insightful dashboards on top of our data, e.g. visually appealing journal or institutional pages
* Information Retrieval: Text data mine our abstracts and grants description texts to better understand what the content is really about by extracting contained facts
* Linked Data Browsing: develop an intuitive and innovative approach to simply browse our linked data offering, making it easy and fun to explore -rather than to search- on top of linked data
* Predictive Analytics: train a model using SciGraph data, e.g. funding patterns, to be able to predict the future for an institute or a journal based on their past - the data is there!
