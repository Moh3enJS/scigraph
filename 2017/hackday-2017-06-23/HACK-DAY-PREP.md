# Preparation for the SciGraph Hack Day

## Basic Stuff 

1. Bring your laptop and charger.
1. Install [Slack](https://slack.com/) which will be our main internal communication tool for the day ([sn-hackday] channel (https://sn-hackday.slack.com) - a personal invite will be sent out shortly).
1. Make a note of the official Twitter hashtag for the event [\#SN_HackDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SN_HackDay).
1. Review the agenda, location, and more info about SciGraph by going to the [official event page](http://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/scigraph/sn-scigraph-hack-day).

## Read up on the docs

It would be great if you could take some time to familiarize yourself with the SciGraph data. Please use the following links to get started.

## Think of some hacking Ideas 

Here are some general themes to consider:

* *Data Visualization*: Develop insightful dashboards on top of our data, e.g. visually appealing journal or institutional pages
* *Information Retrieval*: Text data mine our abstracts and grants description texts to better understand what the content is really about by extracting contained facts
* *Linked Data Browsing*: develop an intuitive and innovative approach to simply browse our linked data offering, making it easy and fun to explore -rather than to search- on top of linked data
* *Predictive Analytics*: train a model using SciGraph data, e.g. funding patterns, to be able to predict the future for an institute or a journal based on their past - the data is there!

Here are some more specific questions: 

* What topics are newly emerging in *sustainable cities* research? What is attracting the most attention? Who is putting money into work on cities?
